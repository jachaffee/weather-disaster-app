# weather disaster app

### Overview


Our idea is to make a Weather disaster tracker. With all the crazy weather that is going on nowadays we feel like it would be pertinent to make a App that tracks all the trifling weather. The users will be able to log in, or decide to use our site anonymously, and then they will be directed to a screen where users can search for a particilar area for all of the extereme weather condition in the specified area. Our app will be tracking fires, hurrcianes, tornado, snowfall, earthquakes, landslides, and floods
